# Reddit-Video-Creator

# **IMPORTANT:** Reddit has changed how their posts are stored so this project is temporarily broken. Fix coming next week. Major rework coming as well.

Automatically creates a video which reads out comments in a reddit thread over background gameplay, just like you'd see in youtube shorts or on tiktok

Here's how it works:

1. Find one of the top 10 current posts on hot in AskReddit
2. Using DOM elements, takes a screenshot of the post title and top comment
3. Generate text to speech for the comment and title
4. Download minecraft gameplay and cut to a random part
5. Process everything together using moviepy

# Imporant Info
It uses python3

All necessary libraries are listed at the top imports

# Example of output
